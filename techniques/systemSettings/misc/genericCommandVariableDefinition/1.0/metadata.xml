<TECHNIQUE name="Generic CFEngine Command variable definition">
  <DEPRECATED>This technique version has been superseded by a new version. It will no longer be available in the next stable version of Rudder. Please upgrade to the latest version.</DEPRECATED>
  <DESCRIPTION>Configures a generic CFEngine variable in a common bundle from the output of an executable, to be used in another Technique. This Technique does nothing by itself, you must reuse the variable(s) you will create here in another Technique with the form: $(generic_cmd_var_def.variablename)</DESCRIPTION>

        <LONGDESCRIPTION>
Use of a shell has both resource and security consequences. A shell consumes an extra process and inherits environment variables,
reads commands from files and performs other actions beyond the control of CFEngine.
If one does not need shell functionality such as piping through multiple commands then it is best to manage without it.</LONGDESCRIPTION>
