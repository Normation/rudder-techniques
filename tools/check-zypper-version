# On SLES 10, Zypper is a technical preview which is not usable with
# automatic tools. To be able to use it on SLES 10, we have to check
# that the version is more recent than the one in SLES 10 SP4 (latest SLES 10).
# The version of Zypper provided by SLES 10 SP4 is '0.6.201-0.4.1' and
# '1.0.8' by the SLES 11.
# We need to check that Zypper is at least as recent as on SLES 11 to be
# able to use it with Rudder.
