# List of maintained technique versions
#
# This file is used to detect missing and, more specifically, old versions of techniques that
# "reappear" due to up-merges from old branches.
#
# It should always contain the list of technique versions to be maintained.
# Any missing or extra technique versions will cause tests to fail.
